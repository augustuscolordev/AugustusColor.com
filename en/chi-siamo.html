        <h3>OUR STORY</h3>
        <p>
          Originally founded in 1972 by Giacomo and directed today by his sons
          Augustus and Alessandro Pelliccia (CEO and Head Colorist,
          respectively), Augustus Color is one of the most important
          post-production industries in Europe. <br />

          Located on Via Tivoli, a short drive from the legendary Studios of
          Cinecittà, the family-run company has for 50 years been a constant
          presence in the market of film and European, North African and Middle
          Eastern television production, maintaining consistently a focus on
          quality and attention to detail. <br />

          Today, Augustus Color employs a team of more than 100 people in its
          photochemistry laboratory, archives, restoration and conservation,
          post-production and studio operations. It is the only post-production
          laboratory still capable of developing film film in Italy. <br />

          The company has regularly supported and co-produced Hollywood films
          medium- and big-budget films shot in Italy, such as "To Rome with
          Love" by Woody Allen, the James Bond 007 film "Spectre," Ridley
          Scott's "Exodus: Gods and Kings" by Ridley Scott and the adaptation of
          "Across the River and Into the Trees" by Hemingway directed by Paula
          Ortiz Álvarez. <br />

          In addition, with the resurgence of film as a production format cinema
          for art-house films, Augustus Color has recently provided
          photochemical processing services to many acclaimed films such as Luca
          Guadagnino's "Call Me By Your Name" and "Suspiria," "A Ciambra" and "A
          Chiara" by Jonas Carpignano and "Hannah" by Andrea Pallaoro, all
          awarded in festivals such as Cannes, Film Festival Venice and/or by
          Oscar juries. <br />

          Augustus Color was also the first film lab in Italy to be certified by
          Netflix as suitable for its strict HDR digital standards and has been
          collaborating with the streaming platform since since its arrival in
          Italy. Having been in the film industry for five decades, Augustus
          Color has accumulated an inventory of more than 6,000 titles, some
          dating back to the 1930s, including films in nitrate cellulose and
          cellulose acetate, diacetate and triacetate, stored in a specialized
          temperature controlled just outside Rome. <br />

          The company is also involved in preservation, analog and digital
          restoration of historical films. Among the films restored in Augustus
          Color, there are cult films and Oscar-nominated classics such as
          "Seven Beauties" by Lina Wertmüller, "Nostalghia" by Andrei Tarkovsky
          and the early films of Nanni Moretti. Augustus Color has also recently
          begun working on a number of films shot by three-time Oscar-winning
          cinematographer Oscar winner Vittorio Storaro, including Francis
          Ford's "Apocalypse Now." Coppola and Bernardo Bertolucci's "The
          Sheltering Sky."
